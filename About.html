        About me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am a long term holder of Safemoon, since the 16th of March. I was fasinated by the reflection aspect of the token and started doing the math for me, my family and friends. After a while i desided to create my own calculator that were simple enough for my mom to use, this is where it all started.
        <br> <br>
        On a daily basis i study Information Technology at Aalborg University, in the city of Aalborg, Denmark. I am autodidact when it comes to programming where i started with PHP in 2019. Since then i have taught myself Python, JavaScript/Node.js among other languages and lately started on Solidity.

    <h2>
        Math
    </h2>
    <p>
        The math used to calculate reflections are based on Safemoon Mark aka Defi Mark's formula:
        <br>
        (Volume * Balance) / (20 * Supply)
        <br>
        You can also watch my video explaining the math behind reflections <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l636gYkZok">here</a>
